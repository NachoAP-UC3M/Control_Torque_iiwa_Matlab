%%%% Control LBR Manipulator Motion Through Joint Torque Commands

% Given a set of desired joint configuration waypoints and a torque-controlled manipulator, this example shows how to implement
% the computed-torque controller using the inverseDynamics function. The 
% controller enables the robot to follow the given configuration waypoints along a smooth trajectory. 

%% Bring Up LBR Gazebo Simulation

% Spawn an LBR robot in Gazebo Simulator. Follow steps in the "Getting
% started with gazebo and a simulated turtlebot to launch the Gazebo LBR
% Simulator from from the Ubuntu virtual machine desktop.

% Gazebo LBR Simulator brings up a barebone KUKA Light Weight Robot (LBR) 
% manipulator with no default position, velocity or safety controllers.
% The only way to move the robot is through joint torques. Once the simulation
% starts running, the LBR arm will fall onto the ground due to no joint 
% torque input.

%% Connect to ROS Network from MATLAB&reg;

% In your MATLAB instance on the host computer, run the following commands 
% to initialize ROS global node in MATLAB and connect
% to the ROS master in the virtual machine (where Gazebo is running) through
% its IP address. Replace ipaddress with the IP address of your virtual machine.

%ipaddress = '192.168.1.53';
%rosinit(ipaddress);

% Establish Communication Channel With Gazebo Through Customized Topics

% Gazebo provides two ROS services /gazebo/get_joint_properties and 
% /gazebo/apply_joint_effort that can be used to get joint state and set 
% joint torques. However, the services are too slow to close the torque control
% loop. Therefore, a customized Gazebo plug-in is used so that the joint 
% state/torques in Gazebo can be read/written at a much faster rate through
% the plain ROS topics (publisher and subscriber). The customized Gazebo 
% plug-in is already brought up together with Gazebo LBR Simulator.

[jointTorquePub, jtMsg] = rospublisher('/iiwa_gazebo_plugin/joint_command');
jointStateSub = rossubscriber('/iiwa_gazebo_plugin/joint_state');

%% Create an LBR RigidBodyTree Object from URDF
lbr = importrobot('iiwa14.urdf');
lbr.DataFormat = 'row';

% Set the gravity to be the same as that in Gazebo.
lbr.Gravity = [0 0 -9.80];

% Show home configuration in a MATLAB figure.
show(lbr);

% Pre-Compute Joint Torque Trajectory for Desired Motion

% Load joint configuration waypoints. This gives the key frames for the 
% desired motion of the robot.
load lbr_waypoints.mat

% cdt is the planned control stepsize. We use it to populate a set of time 
% points where the trajectory needs to be evaluated and store it in vector
% tt.
cdt = 0.001; 
tt = 0:cdt:5;

% Generate desired motion trajectory for each joint.
% exampleHelperJointTrajectoryGeneration generates joint trajectories from 
% given time and joint configuration waypoints. 
% The trajectories are generated using pchip so that the interpolated 
% joint position does not violate joint limits as long as the waypoints do not.
[qDesired, qdotDesired, qddotDesired, tt] = exampleHelperJointTrajectoryGeneration(tWaypoints, qWaypoints, tt);

% Pre-compute feed-forward torques that ideally would realize the desired motion (assuming no disturbances or any kind of errors)
% using inverseDynamics. The following for loop takes some time to run. 
% To accelerate, consider used generated code for inverseDynamics. 
% See the last section for details on how to do it.
n = size(qDesired,1);
tauFeedForward = zeros(n,7);
for i = 1:n
    tauFeedForward(i,:) = inverseDynamics(lbr, qDesired(i,:), qdotDesired(i,:), qddotDesired(i,:));
end

%% Reset LBR to Home Configuration in Gazebo

% Use Gazebo-provided service to reset the robot to its home configuration. 
% For details on how to work with ROS service in MATLAB, see Call and
% Provide ROS Services. 
mdlConfigClient = rossvcclient('gazebo/set_model_configuration');

% Compose the required service message. It includes the joint names and 
% corresponding joint positions to send to Gazebo. Call the service using 
% this message.
msg = rosmessage(mdlConfigClient);
msg.ModelName = 'mw_iiwa';
msg.UrdfParamName = 'robot_description';
msg.JointNames = {'mw_iiwa_joint_1', 'mw_iiwa_joint_2', 'mw_iiwa_joint_3',...
                  'mw_iiwa_joint_4', 'mw_iiwa_joint_5', 'mw_iiwa_joint_6', 'mw_iiwa_joint_7'};

% Computed Torque Control

% Specify PD gains.

call(mdlConfigClient, msg)
% Computed torque control is implemented in the for loop below. As soon as
% MATLAB receives a new joint state from Gazebo, it looks up in the 
% pre-generated tauFeedForward and finds the feed-forward torque 
% corresponding to the time stamp. It also computes a PD torque to 
% compensate for the errors in joint position and velocities [1].

% With default settings in Gazebo, the /iiwa_matlab_plugin/iiwa_matlab_joint_state
%  topic is updated at around 1 kHz (Gazebo sim time) with a typical 0.6 
% real time factor. And the torque control loop below can typically run 
% at around 200 Hz (Gazebo sim time).

    % Find the corresponding index h in tauFeedForward vector for joint 
    % state time stamp t.
    h = ceil((t - tStart + 1e-8)/cdt);
    if h>n
        break
    end
    
    % Log joint positions data.
    Q(i,:) = q';
    QDesired(i,:) = qDesired(h,:);
    
    % Inquire feed-forward torque at the time when the joint state is
    % updated (Gazebo sim time).

    % Log feed-forward torque.
    feedForwardTorque(i,:) = tau1;

%% Compare torques

end
%% Inspect Results

% Plot and inspect the actual joint torques and positions versus the desired values. Note that with the feed-forward torque,
% the PD torques should oscillate around zero.

% Disconnect from the robot and shutdown the ROS network.
% rosshutdown

%% Code Generation for Inverse Dynamics

% To speed up torque calculation in a loop, generate code for the inverseDynamics
%  function. 
% Create a function called invDyn. Note exampleHelperMwIiwa14 is a
% codegen-compatible function that re-creates the same object as that 
% returned by importrobot('iiwa14.urdf').
% function tau = invDyn( q, qdot, qddot )
%   #codegen
%   persistent robot
%   if isempty(robot)
%       robot = exampleHelperMwIiwa14;
%   end
%   tau = robot.inverseDynamics(q, qdot, qddot);
%end 

% Then use the following % codegen command
% codegen invDyn.m -args {zeros(1,7), zeros(1,7), zeros(1,7)}
% Finally, with the generated invDyn_mex file, you can replace the
% inverseDynamics call in the for loop
% tauFeedForward(i,:) = inverseDynamics(lbr, qDesired(i,:), qdotDesired(i,:), qddotDesired(i,:));
% with
% tauFeedForward(i,:) = invDyn_mex(qDesired(i,:), qdotDesired(i,:), qddotDesired(i,:));
